# LED Cube

Sometimes around 2009 LED cubes became very popular and being the kind of person who likes to tinker with electronics I decided I wanted to build one.

After purchasing an Arduino Mega and trialing several different java programs that controlled an array of 10 LED's I found one by [Carlos Asmat](http://carlitoscontraptions.blogspot.com)  that seemed todo what I needed.

[Carlos Asmat](http://carlitoscontraptions.blogspot.com) code controlled an array of LED's by taking control input from an array containing all the animation information in the form of binary.

From this I expanded on [Carlos Asmat](http://carlitoscontraptions.blogspot.com)'s program to control the anode's in an array of 64 LED's with 8 additional binary channels to control the cathodes.

This is [Carlos Asmat](http://carlitoscontraptions.blogspot.com) original [code](https://github.com/Darian-Frey/LED_Cube/blob/main/Arduino/POV_code/led_pov.pde)

An 8 by 8 by 8, led cube I built around August 2009

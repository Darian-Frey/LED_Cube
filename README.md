# LED_Cube

Sometimes around 2009 LED cubes became very popular and being the kind of person who likes to tinker with electronics I decided I wanted to build one.

After purchasing an Arduino Mega and trialing several different java programs that controlled an array of 10 LED's I found one by (author name).

(author name) code controlled an array of LED's by taking control input from an array containing all the animation information in the form of binary.

From this I expanded on (author name)'s program to control the anode's in an array of 64 LED's with 8 additional binary channels to control the cathodes.

An 8 by 8 by 8, led cube I built around August 2009
